1) Get proteomes with PAS domain protein counts from InterPro using its API: proteomeDownloader.py

2) Assign taxonomy from GTDB and NCBI based on tax IDs: getTaxonomyFromNcbIByTaxId.py

3) Get protein counts and gene counts (to deal with isoforms later): getProteinCountsFromUniprot.py
   
4) Get Uniprot protein ids of PAS proteins (longest isoforms in case of eukaryotes) and their lengths for each previously identified proteome: getProteinsFromUniprot.py

5) Get and process protein isoforms: getAndProcessIsoforms.py

6) Get domain compositions and counts of PAS domains: getDomainsAndCountsFromUniprot.py
   
7) Normalize PAS protein counts by the total gene counts: normalizeProteinCounts.py

8) Get averages for each taxonomic level: getAverages.py
